## Neighbouring building

The greyed-out buildings were included in the determination of the neighbours, but were not analysed themselves.

## Building patches

Connected buildings were grouped together and their number and area were visualised in a binary representation. In this version, equal class intervals were used.
Possible source of error: Inaccurate building classification can lead to an increase in individual buildings.

In this variant, quantiles were used for classification.

## Average building size

Here, the edge buildings were removed, but still included in the analysis for the remaining buildings.
